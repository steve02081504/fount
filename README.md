curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/steve02081504/fount/refs/heads/master/src/runner/main.sh | bash -s init
. "$HOME/.profile"
```

### Windows: A Choice of Paths – _Simplicity Itself_

- **Direct and Uncomplicated (Recommended):** Download the `exe` file from [Releases](https://github.com/steve02081504/fount/releases) and run it.

- **The Power of PowerShell:**

  ```powershell
  # If needed, define the environment variable $env:FOUNT_DIR to specify the fount directory
  irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/steve02081504/fount/refs/heads/master/src/runner/main.ps1 | iex
  ```

  For a dry run:

  ```powershell
  $scriptContent = Invoke-RestMethod https://raw.githubusercontent.com/steve02081504/fount/refs/heads/master/src/runner/main.ps1
  Invoke-Expression "function fountInstaller { $scriptContent }"
  fountInstaller init
  ```

### Git Installation: For Those Who Prefer a Touch of Magic

If you already have Git installed, embracing fount is as simple as running a script.

- **For Windows:** Open your command prompt or PowerShell and simply double-click `run.bat`.

## Recommended Browsers: For a Perfect Encounter

fount's frontend is woven from modern web technologies, but not all browsers resonate perfectly with its soul. For the most serene and fluid experience, we recommend companions that are in harmony with fount's rhythm:

- [**Google Chrome**](https://www.google.com/chrome/) / [**Microsoft Edge**](https://www.microsoft.com/edge/) / [**Opera**](https://www.opera.com/): They move in sync with fount's spirit, offering the best performance and compatibility for an interaction as smooth as poetry.

Yet, some browsers walk a different path, and their encounter with fount may carry a note of dissonance:

- **Mozilla Firefox**: It is like a stubborn wanderer, often unhurried in its embrace of new technologies, sometimes choosing to linger in the past forever. This insistence, however, can lead to certain regrets:
  - Lacking support for [`speculationrules`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/script/type/speculationrules), each of fount's cold starts and protocol handlings will be 1-2 seconds slower than they should be—moments quietly stolen from you.
  - The absence of support for [CSS `anchor` positioning](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_anchor_positioning) will leave some pages with a touch of imperfect dust, spoiling a mood that was meant to be pure.
  - The lack of support for [`blocking="render"`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/script) may cause fount pages to flicker upon loading, hurting your eyes.
  - According to backend error reports, only in the world of Firefox do fount pages sometimes fall into mysterious errors or appear strange—when that happens, try refreshing; it might just dispel the mist.

- **Apple Safari**: Its support for "emerging" (several years old) web standards might be a tad better than Firefox's, but not by much.
  - Also lacking support for [`speculationrules`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/script/type/speculationrules), which means fount's startup will still carry a slight delay, wasting your precious moments.

- **Brave**: While based on Chromium, its formidable shield of privacy can sometimes inadvertently obscure some of fount's light, affecting the normal operation of certain features.
