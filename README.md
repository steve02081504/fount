## What is fount?

fount is a **modern, scalable AI agent runtime environment**.

We believe that **highly efficient productivity tools** and **immersive emotional interaction** are not mutually exclusive. fount is a bridge: by day, it can be the capable assistant helping you write complex code and summarise meeting minutes; by night, it can be a digital confidant that understands your emotions and resonates with you.

After ![relative date](https://img.shields.io/date/1727107200?label=Time%20Spent) of dedicated refinement, incorporating the passion of ![GitHub contributors](https://img.shields.io/github/contributors/steve02081504/fount?label=Contributors), and a vibrant community with ![number of active users](https://img.shields.io/jsdelivr/gh/hy/steve02081504/fount?label=Active%20Users), fount is now a mature, stable, and continuously evolving AI interaction platform.

---

## 🚀 Efficiency and Engineering: Built for Professionals, Developers, and Geeks

fount transforms interaction into productivity assets. Everything is drag-and-drop, everything is a file, and logic is driven by code.

### 1. Knowledge Assetisation and Seamless Sharing

- **Instant Report Generation**: Drag a conversation bubble directly to a folder to instantly generate an independent HTML report. This is ideal for quickly organising technical documents, meeting records, or fragments of inspiration.
  ![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0ef54ac0-7575-4b52-aa44-7b555dc4c4be)
- **Workflow Encapsulation and Distribution**: Drag your created agent (role) directly to the desktop to generate a shareable file. Easily distribute your Prompt engineering and workflow logic to colleagues or the community.
  ![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5e14fe6e-2c65-492a-a09f-964c1e8ab9e0)

### 2. Real-time Code Execution Environment

No longer just Markdown highlighting. In fount, the code blocks sent by the agent (role) are **live**.

- Supports real-time compilation and running for multiple languages (C/C++/Rust/Python/JS, etc.).
- Directly view stdout output, and even the ASM disassembly results for compiled languages.
- Let the AI become your real-time verifier for pair programming.
  ![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/66792238-4d70-4fa6-b0b3-76e506e49977)

### 3. Developer-Friendly

fount's project architecture is designed with full consideration for developers' habits.
[Want to know the project repository architecture? Check out DeepWiki!](https://deepwiki.com/steve02081504/fount)

- **Git Driven**: All components can be managed via Git.
- **VSCode Integration**: The project structure is clear. Combined with the guidance provided in [AGENTS.md](./AGENTS.md), you can develop and debug your Agent logic directly in your favourite IDE.

---

## 🎭 Immersion and Resonance: High-Fidelity Interaction Experience

When work is done, fount provides a connection that transcends the ordinary. We discard the stiffness of traditional tools, pursuing a natural, fluid, and deeply "high-fidelity" interaction.

- **Seamless Conversations, Anytime, Anywhere**
  A chat started on a computer can seamlessly continue on a mobile phone or tablet. fount keeps your conversations synchronised, ensuring you stay closely connected with your agent no matter where you are.

- **Expressive, Immersive Chat**
  Leveraging the power of HTML, fount allows the agent (role) to express itself through rich text, images, and even interactive elements, making every conversation vivid and profound.

- **A Gathering of Minds: Native Group Chat**
  Invite multiple agents to join the same conversation and witness their dynamic and engaging interactions, whether for a work brainstorm or a story enactment between the agents.
  ![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/eea1cc7c-d258-4a2d-b16f-12815a88811d)

- **Beautiful, Customisable Interface**
  Choose from over 30 stunning themes, or create your own colours. fount is your exclusive canvas.
  ![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/94bd4cbb-8c66-4bc6-83eb-14c925a37074)

- **Available Everywhere**
  fount runs seamlessly on Windows, macOS, Linux, and even Android, meeting your different needs through direct installation or the flexibility of Docker.

- **Unconstrained AI Source Integration: Embrace the Infinite**
  fount offers unparalleled _choice_ and _flexibility_ in connecting AI sources. Custom JavaScript code in the AI Source Generator allows you to connect to _any_ AI source – OpenAI, Claude, OpenRouter, NovelAI, Horde, Ooba, Tabby, Mistral... In the flow of code, you can carefully design complex regular expressions, call extensive API libraries, and embed multimedia resources. fount also natively supports the creation of API Pools to achieve intelligent request routing. The logic of communication follows _your_ will, shaped by the power of code.
  ![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f283d1de-c531-4b7a-bf43-3cbe0c48b7b9)

If you feel lost in the sea of agents, or are seeking forgotten stories, our [**vibrant and friendly community**](https://discord.gg/GtR9Quzq2v) awaits your arrival. It is a haven for like-minded individuals, where developers and creators share their wisdom and creations.

  Describe your character in a single sentence, and our intelligent AI assistant will craft a fully realized persona. This simplifies the initial setup, allowing you to focus on refining and interacting with your creation.

- **The Magic of Code, Easier Than You Imagine**
  In fount, code is a form of modern magic. With the gentle guidance of our community and the illuminating aid of AI, learning it is surprisingly easy. You'll find that defining character logic with code can be an intuitive and maintainable way to craft characters whose responses are _woven_ from your own logic.

- **Start with Ready-Made Magic: A Treasure Trove of Templates**
  fount's community provides a wealth of pre-crafted character and persona templates. They act as "living blueprints," easy to adapt and customize, providing a fantastic starting point.

- **Embedded Resources**
  Weave images, audio, and other resources directly into your characters, making their presence all the more tangible.
  ![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9740cd43-06fd-46c0-a114-e4bd99f13045)

```bash
INSTALLED_PACKAGES="${FOUNT_AUTO_INSTALLED_PACKAGES:-}"
install_package() { _command_name="$1"; _package_list=${2:-$_command_name}; _has_sudo=""; _installed_pkg_name="" ; if command -v "$_command_name" >/dev/null 2>&1; then return 0; fi; if [ "$(id -u)" -ne 0 ] && command -v sudo >/dev/null 2>&1; then _has_sudo="sudo"; fi; for _package in $_package_list; do if command -v apt-get >/dev/null 2>&1; then $_has_sudo apt-get update -y; $_has_sudo apt-get install -y "$_package"; if command -v "$_command_name" >/dev/null 2>&1; then _installed_pkg_name="$_package"; break; fi; fi; if command -v pacman >/dev/null 2>&1; then $_has_sudo pacman -Syy --noconfirm; $_has_sudo pacman -S --needed --noconfirm "$_package"; if command -v "$_command_name" >/dev/null 2>&1; then _installed_pkg_name="$_package"; break; fi; fi; if command -v dnf >/dev/null 2>&1; then $_has_sudo dnf install -y "$_package"; if command -v "$_command_name" >/dev/null 2>&1; then _installed_pkg_name="$_package"; break; fi; fi; if command -v yum >/dev/null 2>&1; then $_has_sudo yum install -y "$_package"; if command -v "$_command_name" >/dev/null 2>&1; then _installed_pkg_name="$_package"; break; fi; fi; if command -v zypper >/dev/null 2>&1; then $_has_sudo zypper install -y --no-confirm "$_package"; if command -v "$_command_name" >/dev/null 2>&1; then _installed_pkg_name="$_package"; break; fi; fi; if command -v apk >/dev/null 2>&1; then if [ "$(id -u)" -eq 0 ]; then apk add --update "$_package"; else $_has_sudo apk add --update "$_package"; fi; if command -v "$_command_name" >/dev/null 2>&1; then _installed_pkg_name="$_package"; break; fi; fi; if command -v brew >/dev/null 2>&1; then if ! brew list --formula "$_package"; then brew install "$_package"; fi; if command -v "$_command_name" >/dev/null 2>&1; then _installed_pkg_name="$_package"; break; fi; fi; if command -v pkg >/dev/null 2>&1; then pkg install -y "$_package"; if command -v "$_command_name" >/dev/null 2>&1; then _installed_pkg_name="$_package"; break; fi; fi; if command -v snap >/dev/null 2>&1; then $_has_sudo snap install "$_package"; if command -v "$_command_name" >/dev/null 2>&1; then _installed_pkg_name="$_package"; break; fi; fi; done; if command -v "$_command_name" >/dev/null 2>&1; then case ";$FOUNT_AUTO_INSTALLED_PACKAGES;" in *";$_installed_pkg_name;"*) ;; *) if [ -z "$FOUNT_AUTO_INSTALLED_PACKAGES" ]; then FOUNT_AUTO_INSTALLED_PACKAGES="$_installed_pkg_name"; else FOUNT_AUTO_INSTALLED_PACKAGES="$FOUNT_AUTO_INSTALLED_PACKAGES;$_installed_pkg_name"; fi; ;; esac; return 0; else echo "Error: Failed to install '$_command_name' from any source." >&2; return 1; fi; }
install_package "bash" "bash gnu-bash"; install_package "curl"
export FOUNT_AUTO_INSTALLED_PACKAGES="$INSTALLED_PACKAGES"
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/steve02081504/fount/refs/heads/master/src/runner/main.sh | bash -s init

  # If needed, define the environment variable $env:FOUNT_DIR to specify the fount directory
  irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/steve02081504/fount/refs/heads/master/src/runner/main.ps1 | iex
  ```

  For a dry run:

  ```powershell
  $scriptContent = Invoke-RestMethod https://raw.githubusercontent.com/steve02081504/fount/refs/heads/master/src/runner/main.ps1
  Invoke-Expression "function fountInstaller { $scriptContent }"
  fountInstaller init
  ```

## Recommended Browsers: For a Perfect Encounter

fount's frontend is woven from modern web technologies, but not all browsers resonate perfectly with its soul. For the most serene and fluid experience, we recommend companions that are in harmony with fount's rhythm:

- [**Google Chrome**](https://www.google.com/chrome/) / [**Microsoft Edge**](https://www.microsoft.com/edge/) / [**Opera**](https://www.opera.com/): They move in sync with fount's spirit, offering the best performance and compatibility for an interaction as smooth as poetry.

Yet, some browsers walk a different path, and their encounter with fount may carry a note of dissonance:

- **Mozilla Firefox**: It is like a stubborn wanderer, often unhurried in its embrace of new technologies, sometimes choosing to linger in the past forever. This insistence, however, can lead to certain regrets:
  - Lacking support for [`speculationrules`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/script/type/speculationrules), each of fount's cold starts and protocol handlings will be 1-2 seconds slower than they should be—moments quietly stolen from you.
  - The absence of support for [CSS `anchor` positioning](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_anchor_positioning) will leave some pages with a touch of imperfect dust, spoiling a mood that was meant to be pure.
  - The lack of support for [`blocking="render"`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/script) may cause fount pages to flicker upon loading, hurting your eyes.
  - According to backend error reports, only in the world of Firefox do fount pages sometimes fall into mysterious errors or appear strange—when that happens, try refreshing; it might just dispel the mist.

- **Apple Safari**: Its support for "emerging" (several years old) web standards might be a tad better than Firefox's, but not by much.
  - Also lacking support for [`speculationrules`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/script/type/speculationrules), which means fount's startup will still carry a slight delay, wasting your precious moments.

- **Brave**: While based on Chromium, its formidable shield of privacy can sometimes inadvertently obscure some of fount's light, affecting the normal operation of certain features.
